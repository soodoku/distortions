## Replication Data and Scripts for Deliberative Distortions

Paper: [BJPS article](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007123421000168);
[preprint](http://gsood.com/research/papers/DeliberativeDistortions.pdf).

### Versions

The [`paper-2022` tag](https://github.com/soodoku/distortions/tree/paper-2022)
preserves the historical replication at commit `497d2ae`. Its scripts, tables,
figures, and data are identical to the original files preserved through v1.1.0.
The audit documents discrepancies between those files and some published statements.

The working tree contains the current analysis: `scripts/` writes tables to
`tabs/` and figures to `figs/`. Earlier versions remain available through Git;
there is one set of current scripts and outputs.

### Analysis

The current analysis implements Equation 3 consistently, uses valid group-issue
pairs in aggregation, and removes 217 duplicated participant records. It analyzes
5,867 retained records, 397 groups, 129 policy indices, and 2,480 group-issue pairs.
[AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) reports numerical changes, their interpretation, and the
consequences of alternative sample and weighting choices.

Poll-clustered CR2 with Satterthwaite inference is primary. Available responses at
each wave remain the primary sample. The
[paired-response comparison](tabs/09_paired_response_sensitivity.csv),
[frequency comparisons](tabs/09_frequency_comparison.csv), and
[attitude-change weights](tabs/05_attitude_change_weighting.csv) report alternatives.

### Reproduction

Dependencies are declared in [DESCRIPTION](DESCRIPTION) and pinned in
[renv.lock](renv.lock) for R 4.6.0. From the repository root:

```sh
make restore
make ci
```

`make ci` runs local linting, the analysis, audit checks, and tests.
It does not require a hosted CI service. To regenerate only the analysis, run
`make analysis` or `Rscript scripts/run_all.R`.

To check the audit comparisons against the saved outputs:

```sh
Rscript scripts/checks.R
```

This single audit script verifies the main published-versus-current comparison
and provenance coverage, then computes the missing-mean, reference-tie,
duplicate-record, aggregation, and combined-predictor comparisons. It reuses the
analysis definitions and reads historical poll summaries from `paper-2022` using
Git. Run `git fetch --tags` first if that tag is missing from your clone.

The R commands use the project library through `.Rprofile`. Run `make restore`
once to install the locked dependencies; `--vanilla` bypasses that library.
